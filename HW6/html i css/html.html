    <h1>Tyrannosaurus is a genus of tyrannosaurid theropod dinosaur.</h1>
    <h2>The species Tyrannosaurus rex, commonly abbreviated to T.rex was one of the largest land carnivores of all time.</h2>
    <p>Some scientists consider the slightly older Tarbosaurus bataar from Asia to represent a second species of Tyrannosaurus,
      while others maintain Tarbosaurus as a separate genus. Like other tyrannosaurids, Tyrannosaurus was a bipedal carnivore
      with a massive skull balanced by a long, heavy tail. Relative to the large and powerful hindlimbs, Tyrannosaurus forelimbs
      were small and retained only two digits.</p>
    <p>Although other theropods rivaled or exceeded T.rex in size, it was the largest known tyrannosaurid and one of the largest
      known land predators, measuring over 12 metres (40 feet) in length and weighing as much as an elephant. </p>
    <p>Fossils of some T.rex have been found in North American rock formations dating to the very end of the Cretaceous Period
      (late Maastrichtian stage, 65 million years ago); it was among the last dinosaurs to exist prior to the Cretaceous-Tertiary
      extinction event. More than 30 specimens of T.rex have now been identified, some nearly complete, which has allowed
      significant research into many aspects of its biology, including its life history and biomechanics. The feeding habits
      and potential speed of T.rex remain controversial.</p>
