        <p><font color="white">Aatrox is a legendary warrior, <br>
        one of only five that remain of an ancient race known as the Darkin.<br>
         He wields his massive Blood Price blade with grace and poise, <br>
         slicing through legions in a style that is hypnotic to behold. <br>
         With each foe felled, Aatrox's seemingly living Blood Thirst blade drinks in their blood, <br>
         Blood Well empowering him and fueling his brutal, elegant campaign of slaughter.<br>
            The earliest tale of Aatrox is as old as recorded history. <br>
            It tells of a war between two great factions remembered only as the Blue Team Stag profileicon Protectorate and the Red Team Owl profileicon Magelords. <br>
            Over time, the Magelords won a series of crushing victories, leaving them on the brink of obliterating their sworn enemy forever. <br>
            On the day of their final confrontation, the Protectorate army found themselves outnumbered, exhausted, and poorly equipped.
             They braced for inevitable defeat.<br>
            Just when all hope seemed lost, Aatrox appeared among the ranks of the Protectorate. With but a few words,<br>
             he urged the soldiers to fight to the last before throwing himself into battle. <br>
            His presence inspired the desperate warriors.<br>
             At first, they could only watch in awe as this unknown hero cleaved through their enemies,<br>
            his body and blade moving in unison as if one being. Soon,<br>
             the warriors found themselves imbued with a potent thirst for battle. They followed Aatrox into the fray, <br>
             each fighting with the furious strength of ten until they had won a most unlikely victory.</font></p>
