            Iceborn warmother of the Avarosan profileicon Avarosan tribe, <br>
            Ashe commands the most populous horde in the north. Stoic, intelligent, 
            and idealistic, yet uncomfortable with her role as leader,<br>
             she taps into the ancestral magics of her lineage to wield a bow of True Ice. <br>
             With her people's belief that she is the mythological hero Avarosa reincarnated,<br>
              Ashe hopes to unify the Freljord once more by retaking their ancient, tribal lands..</font></p>
